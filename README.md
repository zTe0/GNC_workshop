# GNC_workshop
- Minor issues and bugs were identified but left unresolved (not mentioned on the original assignment papers), as they did not dramatically impact the academic objectives of the project.
- SPICE (NASA) installation is required to run most of the .m files, currently all but Assign1_Ex2 require it.
